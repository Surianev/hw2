# CS 360: More Scheme

Please put anything else you would like us to know here.

Problem 1 took me a very long time to figure out and most of the time spent was reviewing streams. After solving it however, the other problems made much more sense and I was able to solve them a lot faster. It also took me a long time to figure out the helper function in problem 4. TAs were very helpful for this homework assignment.
